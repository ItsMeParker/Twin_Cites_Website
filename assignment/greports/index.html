<p>
For this assignment for twin cities, our group decided to use Leicester and its twin city Strasbourg. As we looked over the assignment, splitting up the roles was difficult as we are of different abilities when it comes to Web oriented programming.
</p>

<h2>Group Contributions</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The conceptual model was handled as a group using the rough outlines provided in the assignment specification. It didn't provide any challenges other than working out what attributes were relavent to the project</li>
  <li>The logical model was handled as a group. It didn't trouble us as we were confident in our conceptual model</li>
  <li>Database implementation was handled by Robert Fry, implementing it on his UWE SQL server which is accessed by a specific script. This had to be modified as the website was developed, integrating changes that we made</li>
  <li>The mapping API was taken care of by Connor Parker, using Google Maps, overcoming some usage bugs that appear with viewport issues, later fixed when streamlining the solution</li>
  <li>The weather API was handled by Robert Fry, using yahoo weather to add information to the database in order to allow us to update forcasts and relay this information to the website</li>
  <li>The XML configuration and validation schema was handled by Alex Foulds, defining all the values used in the website. Throughout development, these files were changed to fit the needs of the website</li>
  <li>The RSS was handled by Agustin Ovari Vrandecic, parsing the database and displaying the query results </li>
</ul>
<p>As a group, we feel that the work was spread out evenly, with all of us helping eachother in debugging, streamlining and creating the website content. The solution may not be what we initially had in mind, however given the different situations that each group member is in, we are proud of the final result</p>
